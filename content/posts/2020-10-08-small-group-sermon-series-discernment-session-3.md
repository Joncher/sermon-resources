### Scripture

#### *Proverbs 14:8 \[ESV]*

8 The wisdom of the prudent is to discern his way, but the folly of fools is deceiving.

<hr/>

### Introduction

We are often foolish and make decisions in a reactive and anxious state. Discernment requires wisdom and prudence. In this sermon, Pastor Rich talks about some practical ways we can use our mind to discern.

<hr/>

### Opening Questions

* When was the last time you have made an important decision (finance, relationship, career, etc.) and really thought it through? How can you distinguish a wise decision from a foolish one?

The Prudent - thinks ahead, patiently giving careful thought to the long-term implications of their decisions.

1. What are some of the characteristics of a fool according to the bible? What does the bible say about people who are stuck in their ways?
2. We often don’t use our heads and suffer needlessly. Where in my life have I been foolish?

3. What are some of the reasons that prevent us from being prudent?

Leader’s note: tradition, culture, family, living in reality, stuck in our ways, lizard brain, etc.

4. All of us know how to bring up anxiety when there is no anxiety and the lizard brain overrides the prudent brain in a reactive and anxious way that leads us to foolishness. Share a time when you were reactive and anxious.

5. We can be prudent in some areas and fools in others. (Finances, time, relationships, etc.) What areas do you think you are more prudent in and what areas more foolish with?
6. Grace is God doing for us and in us what we cannot do for ourselves. Where does the gospel of transforming grace come in this picture?

Leader’s note: We will have seasons of foolishness. In an act of fear and anxiety, anyone might make a bad decision. It may be helpful to remind the group the good news that God loves us in our foolishness.

<hr/>

### Application

Think about one serious decision you have to make. Ask these seven practical questions that come from Pastor Rich’s failures. To keep each other accountable, follow up and share with the group during the next session.

1. Am I rushing?
2. Am I avoiding the hard work of thinking?
3. Do I understand the options before me?
4. Have I considered my limits and the limits of those around me?
5. Have I honestly assessed my strengths and weaknesses?
6. Am I freely making this decision, or am I being pressured to do so?
7. Have I worked hard to understand the implications of this decision?

### Pray Together

Lord, we are often foolish and step out in anxiety. You call us to a life of prudence and wisdom. Fill us with your breath and your presence. Help us this week to step out in faith.
